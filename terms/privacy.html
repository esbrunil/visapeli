                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our website and associated services. By accessing or using our platform, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.
                    
                    <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
                    When signing into the website, you have the option to: <br/>
                    
                    1. Apply a custom name of your choice, or <br/>
                    2. Use a randomly generated name provided by our system. <br/>
                    The selected or generated name is temporarily stored in our database. The aforementioned randomly generated names are word combinations that have no connection to you or other real-world persons. Any instance of a randomly generated name coinciding with a real-world counterpart is purely coincidental and unintentional.
                    
                    <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
                    The stored name may be shown to other users of the platform through a Hall of Fame.
                    
                    <h3>Data Retention</h3>
                    Your name is automatically removed from our database in the following scenarios: <br/>
                    
                    When you close the website, provided other users are still active on the platform. <br/>
                    If all users disconnect, the session data is deleted after a new user opens the platform.
        
                    <h3>Your Privacy Rights</h3>
                    We are committed to ensuring your information is treated securely and not shared to third parties.
                    
                   <h3>Updates to This Policy</h3>
                    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our services or applicable laws. All updates will be reflected on this page.
