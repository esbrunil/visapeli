            <h3>Visapeli</h3>
            Visapeli is an incredible experience in which you will dive into a world of information and knowledge. After dedicating countless hours into this masterpiece of educational design,
            you may finally achieve the pure respect among your friends and peers alike. Usually after blurting out random pieces of pocket-information at convenient times or simply destroying your
            friendgroup in the yearly Trivial Pursuit run in your favourite bar.
            <h3>About us</h3>
            The game was made my four guys in the University of Jyväskylä as a result of a 4 month project. You can probably not contact us. Sorry. This is likely to change in case the software is developed further.<br/><br/>
